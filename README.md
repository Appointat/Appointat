# **Professional Snapshot**


Welcome! I'm a forward-thinking software engineer with a strong focus on user-driven application development and innovation with Large Language Models (LLM).

As a core contributor to DB-GPT (14K+ stars), I maintain and optimize the Graph RAG module, enabling efficient retrieval and application of graph data. I am also an active contributor to the CAMEL-AI (10K+ stars) open-source community, participating in the development of multi-agent systems and interactive agents. Additionally, I maintain Chat2Graph open-source, an innovative multi-agent LLM for graph dialogue that integrates graph operations with natural language to enable intelligent interactive analysis of complex graph data. Previously, I served as a backend engineer for the Ocademy open-source community, leveraging AWS architecture and DynamoDB to optimize system performance. I also independently developed a product similar to New Bing, implementing precise embedded links in responses and detailing how to effectively guide AI learning through resource links.RetryClaude can make mistakes.

My mathematical proficiency is not just academic; it's proven in practice, with recognition as an Outstanding Winner in the [Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm). This underscores my capability in applying theoretical models to real-world challenges.

I'm furthering my skills with a Master's in Computer Science/Engineering in Europe. My background includes enriching internships at ANSYS and Air Liquide and a well-rounded technical skill set in C++, React/JS, Python, and C#/.NET, alongside experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch.

LLM excites me, so what I'm doing or will do (perhaps as a hobby):

1. Enhancing LLM's reasoning abilities, including planning under complex information and solving math problems.
2. Generating and synthesizing data
3. Improving workflow agility for agents [(open sourced)](https://github.com/camel-ai/multi-agent-streamlit-ui/blob/feature/multi-agent/design_docs/concept_of_multi_agent_system.md)
4. Developing a new RAG system with stronger learning capabilities
5. Creating guided agents
6. What is the next

Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy keeping up with the latest technological advancements, delving into personal projects, and sharing insights through my technical blogging.
