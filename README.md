# **Personal Information**

---

Hello, community! ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm a passionate software development engineer dedicated to creating innovative and user-friendly applications.

As a solo developer leveraging the LLM(Large Language Model) to create innovative products, **I am open to opportunities from any organization looking for my unique skillset**. My current focus lies in developing knowledge bases for specific domains and Prompt engineering, underlining my credentials as a full-stack developer. However, my strong suit truly lies in my mathematical agility and ability to solve practical problems with mathematical models. This was proven when I achieved the Outstanding Winner award in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (a distinction earned by just 0.2% of participants worldwide) for proposing a resource and power allocation model for American river reservoirs based on auction theory and marginal benefits.

Currently, I'm pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science/Engineering üíª at Sorbonne University Alliance (French). Through internships at ANSYS and Air Liquide, I've gained valuable experience in software development. My skills include languages such as C++, React/JS, Python, and C#/.NET, along with experience working with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.

In my study, my goal is to become a proficient engineer in designing business information system architectures. My studies provide a comprehensive approach to architectures, networks, systems, and distributed applications, equipping me to manage projects in the IT infrastructure field. I aim to master application architectures and their underlying installations, enabling me to size, design, deploy, secure, and supervise IT systems for companies using ever-evolving technologies.

During my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest technology trends, expanding my knowledge through personal projects, and writing technical blogs.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub profile. I hope you find my projects interesting üëâ and I'm excited to connect with you.
