# **Professional Snapshot**


Welcome! I'm a forward-thinking software engineer with a strong focus on user-driven application development and innovation with Large Language Models (LLM). Currently, I'm seeking roles that can benefit from my expertise in domain-specific knowledge bases, prompt engineering, and open-source contributions.

As a core maintainer and contributor at the CAMEL-AI (10 k stars) open-source community, I spearhead the design, development, and maintenance of multi-agent systems and interactive agents. I am also a core contributor of DB-GPT (14k star), maintaining the Graph RAG module. In addition, I serve as a backend engineer for Ocademyâ€™s open-source community, harnessing AWS and DynamoDB to drive our systems. I also independently developed a product akin to New Bing that offers embedded links in responses, demonstrating and detailing how to guide AI learning with resourceful links.

My mathematical proficiency is not just academic; it's proven in practice, with recognition as an Outstanding Winner in the [Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://www.comap.com/contests/mcm-icm). This underscores my capability in applying theoretical models to real-world challenges.

I'm furthering my skills with a Master's in Computer Science/Engineering in Europe. My background includes enriching internships at ANSYS and Air Liquide and a well-rounded technical skill set in C++, React/JS, Python, and C#/.NET, alongside experience with TensorFlow and PyTorch.

LLM excites me, so what I'm doing or will do (perhaps as a hobby):

1. Enhancing LLM's reasoning abilities, including planning under complex information and solving math problems.
2. Generating and synthesizing data
3. Improving workflow agility for agents [(open sourced)](https://github.com/camel-ai/multi-agent-streamlit-ui/blob/feature/multi-agent/design_docs/concept_of_multi_agent_system.md)
4. Developing a new RAG system with stronger learning capabilities
5. Creating guided agents
6. What is the next

Outside of my professional endeavors, I enjoy keeping up with the latest technological advancements, delving into personal projects, and sharing insights through my technical blogging.

Discover more about my contributions on my GitHub. I'm eager to connect and explore how we can drive innovation together.

**Open for Opportunities: I welcome discussions on roles where my unique blend of skills and open-source experience can add value.**
